            <p  class="flex text-center" >Steven Paul Jobs (February 24, 1955 â€“ October 5, 2011) was an American business magnate, inventor, and
                investor. He was the co-founder, chairman, and CEO of Apple; the chairman and majority shareholder of
                Pixar; a member of The Walt Disney Company's board of directors following its acquisition of Pixar; and
                the founder, chairman, and CEO of NeXT. He was a pioneer of the personal computer revolution of the
                1970s and 1980s, along with his early business partner and fellow Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.

                Jobs was born in San Francisco to a Syrian father and German-American mother. He was adopted shortly
                after his birth. Jobs attended Reed College in 1972 before withdrawing that same year. In 1974, he
                traveled through India seeking enlightenment before later studying Zen Buddhism. He and Wozniak
                co-founded Apple in 1976 to sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. Together the duo gained fame and
                wealth a year later with production and sale of the Apple II, one of the first highly successful
                mass-produced microcomputers. Jobs saw the commercial potential of the Xerox Alto in 1979, which was
                mouse-driven and had a graphical user interface (GUI). This led to the development of the unsuccessful
                Apple Lisa in 1983, followed by the breakthrough Macintosh in 1984, the first mass-produced computer
                with a GUI. The Macintosh introduced the desktop publishing industry in 1985 with the addition of the
                Apple LaserWriter, the first laser printer to feature vector graphics.</p>
